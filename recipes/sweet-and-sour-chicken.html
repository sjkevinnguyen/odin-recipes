        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Combine 1 1/2 cups water, 
                    reserved pineapple juice, sugar, vinegar, 
                    and orange food coloring in a medium saucepan. 
                    Bring to a boil over medium head; set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mix 1/4 cup cornstarch and 1/4 cup water together
                    in a small bowl until smooth; pour in saucepan,
                    stirring continuously, until slightly thickened.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place flour, 2 tablespoons cornstarch, egg, salt, and
                    white pepper in a large bowl; gradually whisk in 1 1/2
                    cups water to make a thick batter.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Add chicken pieces; stir until well coated.
