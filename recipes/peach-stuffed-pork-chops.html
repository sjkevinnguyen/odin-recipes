        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>For this peach-stuffed pork chops recipe, I'm going to show you my favorite technique for stuffing pork chops, as well as one of my favorite stuffings for pork. Above and beyond producing something that's visually impressive, we are also flavoring our pork chops from the inside out with this method. So, this is basically a technique video and will work no matter what stuffing you decide to useâ€”although this peach stuffing is absolutely delicious.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 strips bacon, sliced into into 1/4-inc pieces</li>
            <li>1/2 cup diced onion</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons diced poblano pepper</li>
            <li>1 large yellow peach, peeled, pitted, and diced</li>
            <li>8 saltine crackers, crushed</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chicken broth, or as needed (Optional)</li>
            <li>2 double-cut boneless pork chops</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 400 Degrees F (200 Degrees C) with oven
                rack in center position.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook bacon in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until
                almost crisp, about 5 minutes. Add onion and poblano pepper;
                cook until onions turns translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Add
                peach; cool until tender and starting to render some
                juice. Transfer to a bow.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir saltines, thyme, black pepper, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and
                cayenne pepper into peach mixture; add 2 tablespoons
                chicken broth to moisten as needed. Refrigerate until
                ready to use.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lay pork chops flat on your work surface. Cut a pocket
                in the center of each pork chop, starting with a small
                incision on the fat side of chops, exactly halfway down,
                using the tip of a knife to cut as close to the edges as 
                possible without poking through. Try to make pocket
                incisions at least 2 inches wide.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill pockets with peach stuffing, packing, and pressing
                in firmly; season both sides chops with salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat olive oil in an oven-safe skillet over high heat.
                Add chops; sear until browned on one side, about 3
                minutes. Carefully flip chops and transfer skillet to
                the oven
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer
                inserted into the center reads 145 degrees F (63 to 66
                degrees C), about 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer chops to a plate; cover loosely with aluminum foil.
            </li>

            <li>
                Return skillet to the stovetop; place a towel over the hot handle.
                Add 1/4 cup chicken broth and balsamic vinegar; bring to a boil
                while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the
                skillet with a wooden spoon. Off heat, stir in butter. Taste;
                adjust seasoning if desired. Serve sauce over pork chops.
            </li>
